### 1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the vision, functionality, and technical requirements for a wearable technology solution titled "Capturing Conversations for Personality Profiling." The product aims to record and transcribe user conversations (referred to as a "dot stream") to generate psychological profiles based on speech patterns, tone, and emotional cues. This PRD serves as a guide for the software development team to build a functional, secure, and user-friendly system.

### 1.2 Scope
The scope of this product includes:
- Development of a wearable device with audio recording capabilities.
- Creation of a backend system for speech-to-text transcription and natural language processing (NLP).
- Design of a mobile/web application to display psychological insights and user profiles.
- Implementation of robust privacy and security measures to protect user data.

### 1.3 Target Audience
- Individuals seeking personal development and self-awareness.
- Mental health professionals requiring data for patient assessments.
- Users interested in understanding social dynamics and communication styles.

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Concept
The core concept involves a wearable device that continuously captures conversations (including self-talk and interactions with others) as a "dot stream." This audio data is transcribed into text, analyzed using AI-driven algorithms, and mapped to psychological models to create a detailed personality profile. Insights are delivered through a user-friendly app interface.

### 2.2 Key Objectives
- Capture real-time conversational data with minimal user intervention.
- Provide accurate transcription and emotionally nuanced analysis of speech.
- Generate actionable psychological insights based on established models (e.g., Big Five Personality Traits).
- Ensure user privacy and data security at every stage of the process.

  - Provide daily/weekly summaries of conversational patterns and insights.
- **Settings**:
  - Toggle recording on/off with customizable scenarios (e.g., disable during specific times or locations).
  - Adjust privacy preferences (e.g., anonymize data, limit stored recordings).
- **Feedback**:
  - Highlight strengths, potential stressors, and areas for personal growth.
  - Offer actionable suggestions based on analysis (e.g., mindfulness tips for high stress).
- **Accessibility**:
  - Support for multiple languages and accessibility features (e.g., voice narration for insights).

### 3.4 Privacy and Consent Features
- **Opt-In Recording**: Users must explicitly consent to recording conversations; default setting is "off."
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for audio recordings, transcribed text, and analysis data.
- **Data Control**: Allow users to review, edit, or delete recorded conversations and associated profiles.
- **Third-Party Consent**: Notify and request consent from conversation participants (when feasible) via app prompts or audible alerts.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1 Performance
- Transcription accuracy of at least 95% across supported languages and accents.
- Real-time audio processing with a delay of less than 5 seconds for transcription.
- App load time under 3 seconds on standard mobile devices.

### 4.2 Security
- Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for app access to sensitive psychological data.

### 4.3 Usability
